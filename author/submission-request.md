# Send an Article Submission Request

To publish an article at [Genics Blog](https://genicsblog.com){:target="_blank"}, first you would need to [create a new issue](https://github.com/genicsblog/genicsblog.com/issues/new/choose){:target="_blank"} on the repository with the **Submission Request** template.

---

The issue template contains a set of questions that would ease the publishing process for us.

## Idea

In this space you can describe what topic you want to write an article on and other general information you would like to share with us.

## Topics

This section asks you to list the primary **Category** and the **Tags** this post would belong to. **You can propose new categories and tags!**

Remember, **a post can have only 1 Category and a maximum of 3 tags** (Exceptions can be made, please [contact us](https://genicsblog.com/contact){:target="_blank"} in such case)

## Cross-posting

Content at Genics is classified into two categories:

- **Originals**: Freshly written content. *Authors at Genics own what they write* and we allow them to republish it at their own site, but after setting proper canonicals back to the original article. This ensures search engines that the content isn't copied.

- **Cross posts**: Article which are already published by authors somewhere and they wish to share it at Genics. We happily add canonicals back to the original content. But remember, *cross-posts don't get the [seo backlink benefits](http://genicsblog.com/about#how-can-you-benefit)*.

If you want to share your pre-written article, please add a link to that in this section. If this is an original submission, put N/A.

## Remarks

In this section, you can share some additional information if you wish to.

Once you submit a request, someone from the Genics team would respond if you can start working on the initial draft of the article!
