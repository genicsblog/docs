# Publishing the draft post

Once you are assured that your draft is ready, you can publish it. This document provides the steps to do so.

Prerequisites:

- [Create a draft post](/author/writing-the-article)

---

## Get reviewed

Once you think the draft is ready, it's the time to go back to the original [issue you created](/author/create-a-submission-request#send-an-article-submission-request) for this draft. Go ahead and add a comment over there to let us know that you are done with your draft.

We'll go through the draft and make basic edits on grammar, styling, formatting and some SEO related things. Smaller changes will be made without your approval but if we need any clarification, we'll get back to you in the same issue thread.

Once your draft has gone through the review process, the draft file will be moved to the `_posts` folder which will get it published to the blog!

Congrats on getting your post published to the [Genics Blog](https://genicsblog.com){:target="_blank"}!
